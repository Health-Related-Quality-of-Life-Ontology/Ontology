InADVANCE Health-related Quality of Life Needs Assessment (HRQoL-NA) Taxonomy
InADVANCE developed a taxonomy for health quality of life needs assessment in order to capture the main terms used when assessing health related quality of life for patients with chronic illnesses (using respiratory illnesses as an example). 
Purpose – The main aim of the taxonomy is to support automating the analysis of conversations with patients/carers or patient/carer stories. Additionally, this taxonomy can provide the knowledge source for analysing patient content and conversations, and can also be helpful when supporting Palliative Care needs assessment.
Scope - The scope of the taxonomy is the Quality of Life of patients with Chronic Illnesses (we further focus on respiratory illnesses though most of the terms are applicable to a range of illnesses). The main domain terms identified are linked to the WHO Health Related Quality of Life Knowledge sources (WHOQOL-100 1) and to relevant ontologies (MESH 2, COPD ontology 3).
Level of Formality – since the focus is primarily on the terms, only hierarchical relationships are kept in the taxonomy. The taxonomy can be explored as a text file or opened in an ontology editor (e.g. Protégé). 
Knowledge Sources – To identify the main domain concepts and their granularity, we used the following health related websites: Assessing Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in achondroplasia , Needs Assessment Tool: Progressive Disease (NAT: PD) User Guide , Physical Health Components . 
Main categories - Six domain topics (top level concepts in the taxonomy) have been identified: Physical health , Psychological health, Level of Independence, Social Relationships, Environment and Personal Values and Beliefs. 

Ontology development team – Abrar Mohammed and Vania Dimitrova, University of Leeds.

The concepts in each category are presented in the HRQOL-Taxonomy.xlsx.

HRQoL-NA taxonomy evaluation 
To evaluate the suitability of the main categories, domain concepts and their hierarchy, we have passed the taxonomy structure through iteration feedback from InADVANCE partners. 
First, we assessed the taxonomy structure with a project officer at AGE. The feedback we had got was to make the following changes: expanded Personal Values and Beliefs by adding ‘living alone’, expand Social Relationships by adding ‘loneliness’, ‘isolation’, and add the sub concept ‘sense of loneliness’ to the generic concept ’negative feeling’ within the topic Psychological Health. Additionally, we replaced the concept ‘climate’, within the generic concept ’physical environment’, with the specific concepts; ’heat’, ’draught’, ’humidity’, ’cold’ and ’flood’.
Following these changes, we commenced another iteration feedback to check the validity of the resulting taxonomy. For this purpose, we asked experts from AUTH (working in Medical Informatics Education in the School of Medicine in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece) for feedback. In response, new concepts have been recommended; the Activities of Daily Living and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living to the topic ’Level of Independence’. We researched these generic concepts and found the most related concept to add to the domain taxonomy is ’Activities of Daily Living’ which includes 5 sub concepts: toileting, showering, bathing, food preparation and caregiver assistance. After we made the changes, we sent the domain taxonomy for third feedback to members of the InADVANCE team to evaluate the latest changes.
